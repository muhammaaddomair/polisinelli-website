                  Q: What is your favorite Polsinelli memory?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  A: There are so many! But one that really stands out and was
                  really impactful and emotional for me was right after I got my
                  offer to be a first-year associate and they invited me to come
                  to the old annual Plaza Lights Party (which should totally be
                  brought back Chase!).
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Another great one for me is actually a few different ones
                  combined. Before I left for Milhaus, I left 2 other times to
                  pursue political positions. First it was 2008 and I left to go
                  join the Obama campaign. The second was to go to Mayor James'
                  office as Chief of Staff. You would think when a young
                  associate was leaving the firm would just wave goodbye, but
                  Russ and Chase were always so encouraging and said I always
                  had a home at Polsinelli. It really made me feel like family
                  and I've never forgotten that.

                  Q: How did your time at Polsinelli prepare you for your
                  current job?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  A: I always joked that we were developers for hire. Petersen,
                  Chase and Korb all stressed that we needed to learn our
                  client's business. Not just their legal issues. We did
                  proformas on deals. We helped solve issues with site plans. We
                  really were part of the development team and not just their
                  lawyer. While I had to learn some stuff when I came to
                  Milhaus, the foundation was securely built and the network of
                  people across the city and country from a business development
                  standpoint was in place.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  A: I love the thrill of the hunt. Finding a new project,
                  getting it under control. Getting it through the City's
                  processes on zoning etc. It is all super exciting for me and
                  it all ties back to the skills I learned as a lawyer at
                  Polsinelli.

                  A: Well with 3 kids, most of my time these days are spent with
                  family. My 2 oldest are boys and are deep into sports so I sit
                  on a lot of sidelines and watch a lot of practices and games.
                  And I love it. Both are into baseball currently and though
                  it's hot and dusty, I won't miss a game if I can help it. Our
                  daughter is 2 now and trying to keep up with her brothers so I
                  have no doubt I'll be watching a lot of sports for the next
                  decade and a half!
