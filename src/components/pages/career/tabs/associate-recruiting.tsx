                      We’re trying to change the legal profession by setting a
                      better example. We want Polsinelli to become the
                      alternative―a safe, supportive place where people can
                      become their best selves, confident that the firm always
                      has their back.

                      welcome. We’re looking for people who want to be part of
                      that mission. They must share our same deeply held values
                      and the desire to be part of something larger than
                      themselves―something collaborative, entrepreneurial, and
                      meaningful.

                      seeking. When we explain what we offer, amazing people who

                      Polsinelli Path is a unique career development program for
                      4th-year associates and above, designed to enhance your
                      overall mentorship experience and provide a custom career
                      and personal development plan entirely made for you. What
                      sets Polsinelli Path apart is that every associate selects
                      their own pathfinder – a firm shareholder or practice
                      group leader – and works with them directly to develop the
                      Path Plan, which includes a vision for their practice,
                      short-term and long-term goals, and the path to make that
                      vision a success at the firm.

              I'm a "born and raised" Polsinelli attorney. I joined the firm
