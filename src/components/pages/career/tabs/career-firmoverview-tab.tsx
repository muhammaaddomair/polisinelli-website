            Close your eyes and try to imagine for a minute what the ideal Am
            Law 100 law firm could be... what a law firm should be.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px]">
            We can. We did. And at Polsinelli, that’s precisely what we’re
            endeavoring to build.

            We can. We did. And at Polsinelli, that’s precisely what we’re

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            Obviously, top firms provide superior legal skills and client
            service. That’s the bare minimum―the price of admission. At
            Polsinelli, we created a firm that treats everyone with the utmost
            respect―top to bottom and side to side. A true meritocracy where its
            personnel effortlessly work shoulder-to-shoulder and across
            practices and offices, creating the opportunity for every individual
            to achieve their very best and thereby can do their best for
            clients.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            We’ve found that our platform offers the ideal opportunity both for
            rainmakers who want to dramatically grow their practices and for
            service lawyers who seek challenging work and an environment that
            sincerely values their important contributions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            Enthusiastically diverse and unreservedly supportive of every
            lawyer, staff, and professional member of the firm, we continuously
            invest in our people to help them achieve their personal and
            professional goals. We hold high expectations of ourselves and each
            other, with a service mindset of going beyond–proactively
            anticipating needs and delivering more than requested.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            The Polsinelli culture values its people–their goals, their
            families, and their personal and professional development. In so
            doing, we believe we are the best place to do the same for our
            clients.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            We vigorously protect our culture. This means we don’t bolt on
            hundreds of lawyers at a time in an ongoing series of acquisitions.
            Instead, we have grown in ones and twos, by finding like-minded
            people who fit our style, value our values, and want to help us
            build the nation’s best domestic law firm. That’s a tough way to
            grow. But we’re committed to avoiding the large mergers or costly
            international offices that can distract us from our mission.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            We’ve never aspired simply to be big. We have learned that if you
            build it, they will come. Our Am Law 100 size is simply what happens
            when you offer something that people are longing for. Top legal
            recruiters regularly tell us that when people learn what we offer,
            they want to be part of it. So, we grow.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[26px] ">
            That’s what we think a law firm should be. Does that sound like
            something you would like to be part of? If so, whether you’re just
            starting your exciting new career or considering making a change for
            the right opportunity, let’s start a conversation.

              I'm a "born and raised" Polsinelli attorney. I joined the firm
              right after law school, and from that first day, I have been
              encouraged to take risks and explore opportunities. Every day is
              new and exciting. I can't imagine myself anywhere else. I have
              never felt limited, and the firm has supported me at every step.
              That's what a law firm should be.
